# Face Recognition Based Attendance System

This project is a face recognition-based attendance system that uses OpenCV and Python. The system uses a camera to capture images of individuals and then compares them with the images in the database to mark attendance.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.  `git clone https://github.com/Sri-Ranganadh/Face-Recognition-Based-Attendance-System`
2.  Install the required packages using  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Open in vs code
2. Run `python create_db.py`
3. Check the Database by `python app.py`.


Still need to run features_extraction_to_csv.py manually after registering all the students.
